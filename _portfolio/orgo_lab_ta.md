While at Hopkins I was a teaching assistant for both introductory and intermediate organic chemistry laboratory courses.

## Chemical Chirality: An Introduction in Organic Chemistry Lab Techniques
Chemical chirality is a project lab designed for chemistry majors which focuses on methods in organic synthesis, purification, isolation, and analysis. As a teaching assistant I led short lectures before each lab and guided students through experiments. In addition, I facilitated data collection and processing (NMR, mass spec, etc.) and proper disposal of reagents. 
 
## Intermediate Organic Chemistry Laboratory
Intermediate Orgo Lab is the second-semester version of Chirality, focusing on much of the same techniques in organic synthesis at a higher level; spectroscopic techniques and subsequent analysis are emphasized to a greater extent.
