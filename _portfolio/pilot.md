As a [PILOT](https://academicsupport.jhu.edu/pilot/) leader at Hopkins I provided academic support to students in peer-led tutoring sessions within numerous classes, including Multivariate Calculus and Organic Chemistry. 

Every week of the semester I created problem sets and associated answer keys aligned with material being covered in the course. In addition, I organized and held review sessions for all students prior to all midterm and final exams in the course.
