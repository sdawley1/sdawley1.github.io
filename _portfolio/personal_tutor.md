Provided one-on-one tutoring for undergraduate students as well as elementary school students within Baltimore public schools.

As a tutor for the [Tutorial Project](https://studentaffairs.jhu.edu/socialconcern/tutorial-project/), I volunteered with elementary school students during the semseter to provide personalized tutuoring in math, reading, and writing. Separately, I acted as a tutor within the [Learning Den](https://academicsupport.jhu.edu/learning-den/) at Hopkins, helping students in Linear Algebra, Multivariate Calculus, Organic Chemistry, Physical Chemistry, and Introductory Data Science courses.
