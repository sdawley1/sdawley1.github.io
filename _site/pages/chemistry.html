<h3>Physical Chemistry Notes</h3>
<p>
  Notes:  <a href="../assets/img/Pchem Book.pdf">PDF</a>
</p>
  <p>
    My favorite class I took while in college was probably Pchem I, covering thermodynamics and kinetics. That's not to say it wasn't hard, this class was during the same semester I became addicted to coffee and lost the most sleep.
    Nonetheless, I curated all of my notes from the class and collected them in a nice pdf using LaTeX. Depending on how things go, one day I'd like to make it more uniform and readable convert it to a refined text.
    Though, it's certainly not my top priority for the time being. The full document is linked above, and individual chapters (whenever I get around to making them) are here:
    <ul>
      <li><a>Chapter 1</a> - </li>
      <li><a>Chapter 2</a> - </li>
      <li><a>Chapter 3</a> - </li>
      <li>etc.</li>
    </ul>
  </p>

<h3>Data Science Tools</h3>
  <p>
  I took a data science class on semester and coded a few tools for analyzing chemical and materials data. Below are some of those notebooks, mainly my favorites.
  These are also interesting because it was at the time I was just learning Python, so some of the code/algorithms are funny to read.

      <dd> 
        This python notebook uses absorption data collected from samples containing unknown proportions of vesicles, miscelles, and water.
        The ultimate goal is to determine the proportion of vesicles, miscelles, water in each sample using curve fitting and some methods from optimization.
        The corresponding github repo links to a JACS paper which the code is based on.
      </dd>
    <dt><a href="https://nbviewer.org/github/sdawley1/Sunscreen-Visualization/blob/main/sdawley1_hw7.ipynb">Sunscreen Visualization</a></dt>
      <dd>
        Here, a ton of different sunscreens are tested for efficacy. The initial challenge for the assignment was visualization (I thought I did a good job).
        Interesting, the data presented here was collected by a class of first-year undergraduates, hence the reason some of the absorption spectra are more realistic than others.
        The results presented indicate that, unsurprisingly, as SPF increases the ability of the sunscreen to absorb both UVA and UVB gets better!

    <dt><a href="https://nbviewer.org/github/sdawley1/Heat-Capacity-Modeling/blob/main/sdawley1_hw6.ipynb">Heat Capacity Modeling</a></dt>
      <dd>
        It's been said that if there was matter so rare we could only make a single measurement on it, that measurement should be the heat capacity.
        There are two competing methods of heat capacity modeling, the Debye model and the Einstein model. 
        The former of these models treats the vibrations of a solid lattice as phonons in a box and correctly predicts the low-temperature dependence of the heat capacity.
        The latter treats a solid lattice as a large number of 3D quantum harmonic oscillators of the same frequency. This assumption of independence is relaxed in the Debye model, hence the reason Einstein's model is used less.
        While different, both models estimate specific situations very well, and therefore it is common to fit heat capacity data to a linear combination of the models.

    <dt><a href="https://nbviewer.org/github/sdawley1/Kinetic-Equilibrium-Model/blob/main/sdawley1_hw4.ipynb">Kinetic Equilibrium Model</a></dt>
      <dd> 
        Chemical kinetics is great for determining how long a reaction will take, unlike thermodynamics which tells us only about how favorable a reaction is.
        This notebook models equilibrium concentrations of the Haber-Bosch process, the process responsible for artificial nitrogen fixation.
        The main process involves establishing and solving an initial value problem, with known rate constants and initial concentrations.
