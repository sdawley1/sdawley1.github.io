      </p>
      <p>
        Studied Chemistry and gained experience in orgnanic, inorganic, and computational research in multiple labs. <br>
        Additionally, I earned a second degree in Applied Mathematics and Statistics with a focus on Statistics and Statistical learning. <br>
        I also earned a minor in pure Mathematics.

        Earned my diploma and simultaneously earned the Lonergan Award, awarded to two graduating seniors who best exemplify altruism, character, dignity, integrity and loyalty; the most prestigious award given by the school.

  <!-- TEACHING -->
  <h1 id="header-1">Teaching</h1>
    <p>
      During the work week, the only thing I like more than chemistry is talking to other people about it. So, teaching others was an obvious path I wanted to pursue.
      I've been lucky enough to do this with a broad range of students and in a slightly less broad range of subjects.

      <p>
        Intermediate Organic Chemistry Lab is a course taught by Dr. Eric Hill and exists as a second-semester organic chemistry lab class.
        I helped students with organihc synthesis techniques ranging from extraction and filtration to thin-layer and column chromatography. 
        I also managed NMR processing and helped students in analyzing their spectra. Of course, there were mundane tasks to tend to as well such as grading and exam proctoring...

      <p>
        The <a href="https://academicsupport.jhu.edu/learning-den/drop-in-tutoring/">Learning Den</a> is an academic support program offered at JHU meant to provide more personlized, one-on-one tutoring
        for students in introductory courses. Similar to PILOT, I've supported students through the Learning Den in Multivariable Calculus and Organic Chemistry.

        <a href="https://academicsupport.jhu.edu/pilot/#:~:text=PILOT%20is%20a%20loose%20acronym,captain%20and%20facilitates%20the%20meetings.">PILOT</a>
        is an academic support program offered at Hopkins which pairs groups of students with a trained student leader who has been successful in the course already.
        As a leader, I've been able to support students in Multivariable Calculus and Organic Chemistry I & II (6 semesters and counting), leading weekly sessions to review course content.
        Being the <em>head</em> leader, my responsibilities expanded to include creating the problem sets and answer keys for each week (many of the problem sets for all courses supported by PILOT can be found on the PILOT website.
        If you peruse through any problem sets for Calc III created between Fall 2021 and Spring 2023, I made them!) and coordinating with the instructor for the course as to when exam reviews should be held.
