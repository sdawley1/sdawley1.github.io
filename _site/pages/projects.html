      </p>
        <p>
          My favorite class I took while in college was probably Pchem I, covering thermodynamics and kinetics. That's not to say it wasn't hard, this class was during the same semester I became addicted to coffee and lost the most sleep.
          Nonetheless, I curated all of my notes from the class and collected them in a nice pdf using LaTeX. Depending on how things go, one day I'd like to make it more uniform and readable and convert it to a refined text.
          Though, it's certainly not my top priority for the time being. The full document is linked above, and individual chapters (whenever I get around to making them) are here:
          <ul>
            <li><a>Chapter 1</a> - </li>
            <li><a>Chapter 2</a> - </li>
            <li><a>Chapter 3</a> - </li>
            <li>etc.</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
          My favorite section in the (large) PDF linked above is 7.8, titled "Information Theory Applied to Statistical Mechanics". Check it out!

      <em>Another</em> amazing class I took at JHU (there were a few) was Computational Molecular Medicine, a course focused on the applications of information theory and statistical learning to cancer classification.
      I was assigned the problem of classifying cancers as either of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), using gene expression data. 
      The project was based on research done by Golub, et al. (1999) which tackled the exact same problem. The dataset can be found on <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/crawford/gene-expression">kaggle</a>.
      My final report for the class is linked in the github repo above, and can also be read <a href="../assets/img/CMM Final Report.pdf">here</a> directly.

        I'm always trying to learn new programming languages (I think I'm gonna go for C++ next) and so when I saw a set of Jupyter notebooks for learning aerodynamics, written in Python,
        I figured I could do a better job at creating the visuals in those notebooks while learning another language in the process. 
        Granted, that other language is practically a twin of Python. Nonetheless, it was fun! I still need to finish writing the rest of the notebooks,
        only about half are converted to Julia from the original source.

<!-- Data Science Tools -->

      I took a data science class on semester and coded a few tools for analyzing chemical and materials data. Below are some of those notebooks, mainly my favorites.
      These are also interesting because it was at the time I was just learning Python, so some of the code/algorithms are funny to read.

        <dt><a href="https://nbviewer.org/github/sdawley1/UV-Vis-Curve-Fitting/blob/main/sdawley1_hw5.ipynb">UV/Vis Curve Fitting</a></dt>
          <dd> 
            This python notebook uses absorption data collected from samples containing unknown proportions of vesicles, miscelles, and water.
            The ultimate goal is to determine the proportion of vesicles, miscelles, water in each sample using curve fitting and some methods from optimization.
            The corresponding github repo links to a JACS paper which the code is based on.
          </dd>
        <dt><a href="https://nbviewer.org/github/sdawley1/Sunscreen-Visualization/blob/main/sdawley1_hw7.ipynb">Sunscreen Visualization</a></dt>
          <dd>
            Here, a ton of different sunscreens are tested for efficacy.
            Interestingly, the data presented here was collected by a class of first-year undergraduates, hence the reason some of the absorption spectra are more realistic than others.
          </dd>
        <dt><a href="https://nbviewer.org/github/sdawley1/Heat-Capacity-Modeling/blob/main/sdawley1_hw6.ipynb">Heat Capacity Modeling</a></dt>
          <dd>
            It's been said that if there was matter so rare we could only make a single measurement on it, that measurement should be the heat capacity.
            There are two competing methods of heat capacity modeling, the Debye model and the Einstein model. 
            While different, both models estimate specific situations very well, and therefore it is common to fit heat capacity data to a linear combination of the models.
          </dd>
        <dt><a href="https://nbviewer.org/github/sdawley1/Kinetic-Equilibrium-Model/blob/main/sdawley1_hw4.ipynb">Kinetic Equilibrium Model</a></dt>
          <dd> 
            Chemical kinetics is great for determining how long a reaction will take, unlike thermodynamics which tells us only about how favorable a reaction is.
            This notebook models equilibrium concentrations of the Haber-Bosch process, the process responsible for artificial nitrogen fixation.
            The main process involves establishing and solving an initial value problem, with known rate constants and initial concentrations.

<!-- PROBABILITY NOTES -->

        Notes: <a href="../assets/img/Intro Prob Notes.pdf">PDF</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        My second favorite class I took while in college was probably Introduction to Probability, not because it was fun, it certainly was not. 
        That said, the professor, Dr. Torcaso, is incredible and I hope that he lives forever and continues to teach the entire time because his class is incredible.
        Also, Intro Prob is probably the most applicable class I've ever taken, as I find myself using probability and statistics constantly in different projects I take on, so having a great understanding of prob is very beneficial.
        Similar to Pchem, I collected all of my notes in a nice pdf using LaTeX, linked above.
        I've found that compilign up all of my stuff in LaTeX is a great study tool, as writing in a way that I'm trying to write a textbook really forces understanding.
