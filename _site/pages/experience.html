  <h4 style="text-align:left; font-size: 125%;">Platform for the Accelerated Realization, Analysis, and Discovery of Interface Materials</h4>
    <p><small>Summer, 2022<span style="float:right;">Johns Hopkins University</span></small></p>
  <!-- PARADIM -->
  <p>
      With <a href="https://www.paradim.org/">PARADIM</a> I researched methods for on-the-fly data analysis as a means of accelerated materials discovery. 
      As a part of the experience, I developed a statistical algorithm for automatic peak detection in powder X-ray diffraction patterns. Though, in theory, this method could be used for any signal with random background noise.
      The project itself was only a small portion within the broader context of data-driven research. In fact, I was able to collaborate on this work with 
      researchers at the SLAC National Laboratory, ultimately analyzing noise and peak structure within noisy signals.
      <br>
      The majority of my work, including a poster, report, and recording of the presentation, can all be found <a href="https://www.paradim.org/reu_participants">here</a>, under my name.

  <p><small>2022 - present<span style="float:right;">Johns Hopkins University</span></small></p>
  <p> 
    Getting involved in the Cheng Lab at Hopkins allowed me to gather practical experince with methods in computational chemistry as well as further my understanding of quantum mechanics.
    Using the <a href="http://www.cfour.de/">CFOUR</a> program, a package for performing quantum chemical calculations on atoms and molecules using couple-cluster techniques, I began by computing
    polarizibility tensors for small atoms and molecules in sharp agreement with experimental results.

  <!-- <span style="float:right;">Massachusetts General Hospital</span> -->
  <p><small>Summer, 2021<span style="float:right;">Massachusetts General Hospital</span></small></p>
    <p>
      At MGH I worked with <a href="https://medoff-lab.squarespace.com/">Dr. Benjamin Medoff</a> and Dr. Tristan Kooistra to model the spatial distribution of basal cells in coculture with airway epithelium and immune cells.
      The Medoff Lab studies idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF, a disease which causes scarring in lung tissue) and investigates the mechanisms involved in the development of lung inflammation and scarring.
      As a researcher with limited experience of IPF, I could not contribute much on the wet lab side of things. Though, I was able to develop an algorithm for computing and visualizing a Voronoi tesselation of cells in a coculture.
      (The code itself can be found <a href="https://github.com/sdawley1/Bio-Voronoi-Diagram">here</a>. As  warning, this was my very first Python project and so the code is shotty at times. Though, the images came out great!)

  <!-- TOVAR LAB -->
  <h4 style="text-align:left; font-size: 125%;">Undergraduate Research Assistant, Tovar Lab</h4>
  <p><small>2020 - present<span style="float:right;">Johns Hopkins University</span></small></p>
    <p>
      In the Tovar Lab at Hopkins, I studied <em>cycloparaphenylenes</em> (CPPs), macrocycles which are <em>radially</em> conjugated (in contrast to the typical linear conjugation we imagine in, say, 1,3-butadiene)
     and give rise to interesting optical and electronic properties. Whenver I'm asked to describe a CPP my go-to is normally, first, picture a benzene ring. Now, picture a ring that would go around your finger, <em>that's made of benzene rings</em>. That's a CPP!
      <br>
     I developed an optimized synthetic pathway towards the [8]CPP (a CPP ring with 8 benzene monomers) and used the program Gaussian16 to perform computations on the energies of the molecular orbitals of the molecule.
      One of the most interesting facets of CPPs is that their HOMO may be "disrupted" upon addition of aromatic substituents. This is the primary use for Gaussian, being able to compute (and visualize) the ground state energies of the molecular orbitals to determine how (if at all) the energies change when the ring is substituted.
      <br>
      Additionally, I synthesized a novel compound for use as a precursor to the ring-closing step of a CPP synthesis.
