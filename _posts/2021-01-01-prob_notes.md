My second favorite class I took while in college was probably Introduction to Probability, not because it was fun, it certainly was not. That said, the professor, Dr. Torcaso, is incredible and I hope that he lives forever and continues to teach the entire time because his class is incredible. Also, Intro Prob is probably the most applicable class I've ever taken, as I find myself using probability and statistics constantly in different projects I take on, so having a great understanding of prob is very beneficial. Similar to Pchem, I collected all of my notes in a nice pdf using LaTeX, linked above. I've found that compilign up all of my stuff in LaTeX is a great study tool, as writing in a way that I'm trying to write a textbook really forces understanding.
