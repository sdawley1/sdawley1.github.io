I'm always trying to learn new programming languages (I think I'm gonna go for C++ next) and so when I saw a set of Jupyter notebooks for learning aerodynamics, written in Python, I figured I could do a better job at creating the visuals in those notebooks while learning another language in the process. Granted, that other language is practically a twin of Python. Nonetheless, it was fun! I still need to finish writing the rest of the notebooks, only about half are converted to Julia from the original source.
