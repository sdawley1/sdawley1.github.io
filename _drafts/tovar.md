My original research project in the [Tovar lab](https://sites.krieger.jhu.edu/tovar-group/) involved cycloparaphenylenes (CPPs), macrocyclic aromatic compounds exhibiting hybrid linear and radial conjugation. The goals of the project ranged from optimization of synthetic conditions to molecular orbital characterization, both of which I accomplished while leaving behind promising research directions for future students. During this time, I gained expertise in fundamental techniques in organic synthesis, purification, and characterization, including NMR analysis and mass spectrometry. Some key accomplishments of my project include:

- Synthesis of functionalized [8]CPPs and optimized synthetic schemes for total synthesis. In the process, I synthesized a novel aromatic compound that may act as scaffolding for functionalized CPP precursors in the future.
- Molecular orbital characterization with density functional theory using Gaussian on high-powered computing clusters at the Advanced Research and Computing at Hopkins (ARCH, formerly MARCC) facility. In tandem, I wrote a Python script that communicates with the SSH client of ARCH facilities for automatic submission of jobs on computing clusters.

The second research project I adopted and am currently working on concerns the aromaticity of functionalized borepins and their derivatives. Probing aromaticity is done with the Aroma package for Gaussian, a computational plug-in that measures aromaticity using the nucleus-independent chemical shift (NICS) method. As part of my work I authored an *in-progress* SOP for using Aroma as well as a general introduction to the package, geared toward those with a background in organic chemistry.
