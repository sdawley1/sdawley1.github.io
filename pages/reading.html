<h1 id="header-1">Reading List</h1>
<p>
  Below are some of my favorite books, listed in no particular order. Maybe if anyone has read any, we can talk about them!
  A full list of more books that I've read can be found on <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/151908364-sam-dawley">Goodreads</a>.
</p>

  <dl>
    <dt><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40961427-1984"><em>1984</em> - George Orwell</a></dt>
      <dd> 
        Great book. 10/10 would read again. Also the first book that I found myself not able to put down.
      </dd>
    <dt><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1202.Freakonomics"><em>Freakonomics</em> - Steven D. Levitt</a></dt>
      <dd> 
        Steven D. Levitt is some sort of genius. Each chapter focuses on a very specific question, ranging from "why do drug dealers still live with their moms?"
        to "what do schoolteachers and sumo wrestlers have in common?" No matter the question, Levitt stands out among the crowd with his reasons and arguments.
      </dd>
    <dt><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8884400-the-most-human-human"><em>The Most Human Human</em> - Brian Christian</a></dt>
      <dd> 
        My introduction to information theory. I'll never look back. The book itself is about a ton more.
        Christian effortlessly weaves computer science, mathematics, and linguistics into a book that I read in less than 2 days.
      </dd>
    <dt><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10874803-iron-war"><em>Iron War</em> - Matt Fitzgerald</a></dt>
      <dd> 
        "The Greatest Race Ever Run." The <em>Iron War</em> outlines the 1989 Iron Man World Championships in Kona, HI. 
        Also brings a lot of detail into the training, sacrifices, and rivalry the two competitors, Dave Scott and Mark Allen, put into their sport.
      </dd>
    <dt><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/41795733-range"><em>Range</em> - David Epstein</a></dt>
      <dd> 
        A wonderful story about how although the 10,000 hour rule is certainly important, there are 66.6 portions of our life where we could put in those 10,000 hours.
        Whether it's pro golfers or organic chemists, Epstein gives a fantastic account of how generalists can triumph in such a specialized world.
      </dd>
    <dt><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/43848929-talking-to-strangers"><em>Talking to Strangers</em> - Malcolm Gladwell</a></dt>
      <dd> 
        Another banger from Gladwell. The man just doesn't miss. 
        I love many of his books, including <em>David and Goliath</em> and <em>The Tipping Point</em>, but I figured I'd just leave one on this list (for now).
      </dd>
    <dt><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3109.The_Omnivore_s_Dilemma"><em>The Omnivore's Dilemma</em> - Michael Pollan</a></dt>
      <dd> 
        Michael Pollan is slowly but surely becoming one of my favorite authors. From <em>The Omnivore's Dilemma</em> to <em>This is Your Mind on Plants</em>,
        Pollan does an amazing job of combining science, politics, and practicality into his works.
      </dd>
    <dt><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/56302573-farenheit-451"><em>Farenheit 451</em> - Ray Bradbury</a></dt>
      <dd> 
        I mean c'mon. Another classic; read this during the time I was getting really into dystopian novels.
        On a scale of <em>Animal Farm</em> to <em>1984</em>, I'd say this book is a 9.5.
      </dd>
    <dt><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/66354.Flow"><em>Flow</em> - Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi</a></dt>
      <dd> 
        This is the closest thing I've read to an academic paper that isn't an academic paper. At the same time, certainly an amazing book about 
        how people can (re)gain control of their lives.
      </dd>
    <dt><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/41817486-a-clockwork-orange"><em>A Clockwork Orange</em> - Anthony Burgess</a></dt>
      <dd> 
        The first book I've ever read that has a learning curve. The language Burgess uses throughout the novel makes for a tough time reading the first few chapters.
        Though, once you get a hang of using "glazzballs" and "klootch" in a sentence, it becomes a fantastic read and well worth the effort.
