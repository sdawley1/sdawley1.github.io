<!-- INTRODUCTION TO PROBABILITY -->
<h3>Probability Notes</h3>
  <p>
    Notes: <a href="../assets/img/Intro Prob Notes.pdf">PDF</a>
  </p>
  <p>
    My second favorite class I took while in college was probably Introduction to Probability, not because it was fun, it certainly was not. 
    That said, the professor, Dr. Torcaso, is incredible and I hope that he lives forever and continues to teach the entire time because his class is incredible.
    Also, Intro Prob is probably the most applicable class I've ever taken, as I find myself using probability and statistics constantly in different projects I take on, so having a great understanding of prob is very beneficial.
    Similar to Pchem, I collected all of my notes in a nice pdf using LaTeX, linked above.
    I've found that compilign up all of my stuff in LaTeX is a great study tool, as writing in a way that I'm trying to write a textbook really forces understanding.

<h3>Machine Learning Applications in Cancer Classification</h3>

  <p>
    <em>Another</em> amazing class I took at JHU (there were a few) was Computational Molecular Medicine, a course focused on the applications of information theory and statistical learning to cancer classification.
    I was assigned the problem of classifying cancers as either of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), using gene expression data. 
    The project was based on research done by Golub, et al. (1999) which tackled the exact same problem. The dataset can be found on <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/crawford/gene-expression">kaggle</a>.
    My final report for the class is linked in the github repo above, and can also be read <a href="../assets/img/CMM Final Report.pdf">here</a> directly.
